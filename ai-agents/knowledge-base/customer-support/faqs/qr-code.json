      "question": "Can I use the web version without the mobile app?",
      "answer": "Unfortunately, no. IELTS AI Prep requires the mobile app for two important reasons:\n\n1. **Purchase Verification:** All purchases are made through App Store/Play Store. The mobile app verifies your purchase entitlements.\n\n2. **QR Authentication:** The QR code login ensures secure access to the web platform while maintaining your purchase records.\n\nHowever, once you've purchased via mobile, you can use the web version as much as you like by scanning the QR code each session. The web version offers the full assessment experience with a larger screen and keyboard.",
